# Movie App 

A movie app where you can catch up on movies and get information about them.

## Project Description

In the Movie app you can login, logout, sign up, 
search for movies, watch trailers, 
write a comment to a movie in real-time and  
edit account information. 

The app is Single Page Application (SPA) using modern practices
like Context and Reducer.

The combination of Context and Reducer gave me the
the ability to keep my code organized and manageable.

The management of the users on the app is with the help of firebase. 
Firebase provides validations and login via social networks.

## Tech Stack

 React, Sass, Firebase and HTML.
